# External Projects im using

[BitFonts](https://github.com/SloopyCode/BitFonts) (the font mainly used for text in the OS)

[nanoprintf](https://github.com/charlesnicholson/nanoprintf) (simple and usable printf impl for embedded projects)

[uACPI](https://github.com/uACPI/uACPI) (A portable impl of ACPI)

[liballoc](https://github.com/blanham/liballoc) (this is a library that provides a dynamic memory allocator for your kernel) (this isn't used in the kernel outside of testing if my own allocator is working by seeing if everything works with this)

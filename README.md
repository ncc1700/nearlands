# Nearlands

this is a small project I made to continue the ideas I got from furtherium with some stuff I learned from friends, while learning more about osdev in general


im experiementing on making a managed code OS with very little intervention/protection from the processor, such as rings/ELs or paging/MMU protection

the code is an absolute mess and my memory allocators are horrendous and bad but slowly ill make it better as I learn more and more =D

# External Projects im using

[Font8x8](https://github.com/dhepper/font8x8) (the terminals font)

[mini-printf](https://github.com/mludvig/mini-printf) (simple and usable printf impl for embedded projects)

[inih](https://github.com/benhoyt/inih) (simple and extensible INI parser)

# How to build

SOON
